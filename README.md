# Facial Keypoint Detection
### In this project, we have used computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of **68 distinguishing keypoints** on each face!


The project is broken into a few main parts in four Python notebooks,
- Notebook 1 : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data
- Notebook 2 : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints
- Notebook 3 : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN
- Notebook 4 : Fun Filters and Keypoint Uses
